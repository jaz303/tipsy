== DESCRIPTION:

tipsy is a simple jQuery plugin for generating Facebook-style tooltips.

It's used by Twitter, Github, Slideshare and Bitbucket, amongst others.

== HOMEPAGE:

http://onehackoranother.com/projects/jquery/tipsy

== SOURCE:

Hosted at GitHub; browse at:

  http://github.com/jaz303/tipsy/tree/master

Or clone from:

  git://github.com/jaz303/tipsy.git

== USAGE:

1. Copy the contents of src/{images,javascripts,stylesheets} to the corresponding asset directories in your project. If the relative path of your images directory from your stylesheets directory is not "../images", you'll need to adjust tipsy.css appropriately.

2. Insert the neccesary elements in your document's <head> section, e.g.:

<script type='text/javascript' src='/javascripts/jquery.tipsy.js'></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/stylesheets/tipsy.css" type="text/css" />

Remember to include jquery.tipsy.js *after* including the main jQuery library.

3. Initialise Tipsy in your document.onload, e.g.:

<script type='text/javascript'>
	$(function() {
		$('a[rel=tipsy]').tipsy({fade: true, gravity: 'n'});
	});
</script>

Please refer to the docs directory for more examples and documentation.
